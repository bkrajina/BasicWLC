Running Simulations
##################

It is recommended that you always use the scan_wlcsim.py script to run your
simulations. This will make it easy to leverage the :module:`wlcsim`
functionality in your analysis, and keep track of lots of easy-to-forget things
for you, like saving the version of the code used, the parameters used, random
seeds, etc.
